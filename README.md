# Snack-Shakedown

Snack Shakedown was developed for the Godot Jam Round 2 game jam, which lasted a week
with the theme out of order. In the game, players use a vending machine to dispense
snacks in a specific order to create matching patterns in the front row. With limited
money and time, the challenge escalates as harder patterns are required in shorter
periods.

The game featured 5 unique snacks and implemented a fully functional online leaderboard,
showcasing sound design, special effects, and immersion skills. Ratings are pending.
